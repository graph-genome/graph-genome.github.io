## Beta Test

### Call for Testers

We are looking for biologists who will use the tool on a real research project to give us feedback about their experience.  This will let us make improvements to the overall product that are most needed.

The official beta-test will run from June 6, 2020 to July 6, 2020.  During this time scientists will use the Release 1.0 of the product and give feedback.

During the months of July and August 2020 we will roll the software to Release 1.1.  The server will update to Pantograph 1.1.


### Getting Started

Read the Pantograph User Guide located at schematize.github.io.

This guide will show you the basic operation of the software and help you know what to expect.
