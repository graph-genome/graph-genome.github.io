* [Our History](history)

    * Pantograph Project - began in 2019 
    * Pantographâ€™s application to the COVID-19 pandemic - March 2020 
    * COVID-19 Virtual Biohackathon - April 2020 


* [Our Mission](mission)

    * Provide a public server with an instance of Pantograph (Open Source) available to all genetic researchers and vaccine developers
    * Generate a SARS-CoV-2 pangenome from the largest dataset available of de novo genome assemblies
    * Render gene annotations 
    * Include phylogenetic tree with regional labels
    * Create process for data governance in live-updating of all available data
    * Integrate knowledge graph of COVID-19 patient outcomes


## Accomplishments To Date
* Developed a new method for visualizing a Pangenome that can scale to thousands of samples
* 220 SARS-CoV-2 genomes gathered by `public_sequence_resource` team collected and filtered from NCBI
* Pantograph: A team of 8+ people developed Open Source software for browsing Graph Genomes
* [Pantograph - Release 1.0 - June 12, 2020](release_1_0)
* Pantograph Documents and Code


## Get Involved

* How can you help? We need:
    * Grant writers to help with funding search
    * Biologists to do [beta-testing](betatest)
    * Software engineers (with JavaScript or C++ knowledge) for [Release 1.1](release_1_1)
