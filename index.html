        <h2>What is Pantograph?</h2>

        <p>Pantograph is a pangenome browser that provides data visualization for the showing variations due to mutation in DNA samples.</p>

        <h3>COVID-19 Variants Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            As a vaccine is developed for any particular virus it matches specific details within the DNA. This will cause it to be effective on specific strands of the virus but will
            not work for other strands.
        </p>
        <p>
            The variations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be studied to understand the mutations that are already in the population. This is crucial to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            We will analyze the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations. Looking at the sequencing of different samples will reveal the areas that have mutated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating a better understanding of the virus mutations will likely improve the
            effectiveness of any vaccines that will be developed. We believe that ultimately
            this will save lives.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Strategy</h3>
        <p>
            Pangenome datasets are available the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pantograph is a pangenome browser that already exists. This tool can be used study variants of the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our short-term goal is to extend the Pantograph tool to add features to make it
            easier to study the SARS-CoV-2 virus variants.
        </p>
        <h3>Hackathon</h3>
        <p>
            We will be hosting a special event for volunteers to collaborate for one week.
            We hope to build the software to a point where we can analyze the variations
            of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of April. Your contribution could be
            important to helping us stop this killer virus.

                        Start by reading about the pangenome mapping which shows variations
                        of a specific genome.
