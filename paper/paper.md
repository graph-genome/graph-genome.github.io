# Introduction

As part of the one week Biohackathion 2019 in Fukuoka Japan, we formed
a working group on Logic Programming for the biomedical sciences.

Logic programming in the form of relational SQL queries on database
tables and SPARQL queries on semantic web graph data stores, is
well known to many bioinformaticians. More advanced logic programming,
however, is underutilized in bioinformatics.  Prolog, for example, is
a high-level programming language that has its roots in first-order
logic or first-order predicate calculus.  Another example, miniKanren, is an embedded
Domain Specific Language for logic programming. Core miniKanren is
exceptionally simple, with only three logical
operators and one interface operator [@reasoned2nd].

![Logic programming resolver traverses the solution space to find all matches \label{fig}](./logic-programming.png)

The introduction of logic programming is particularly relevant in the
context of multi-model data representations where data can be accessed
in memory as free data structures, but also on disk where data can be
represented as tables, trees (documents), and graphs. In
bioinformatics we can make use of all these different data sources and
have a query engine that can mine them all efficiently.

Logic programming is well-suited for biological research. Essentially,
a researcher writes a number of statements that include variables
representing unknown information.  The logic engine then goes through
the solution space (all data) to find possible matches (see figure
\ref{fig}). Much more detail on the rationale and implementations of
miniKanren and logic programming are well summarized in Byrd's book
\emph{The Reasoned Schemer, Second Edition} [@reasoned2nd], PhD thesis
[@ByrdPhD], and [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQL48qYDwp4)
[talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3AHnyEf7IE).

The `Logic Programming' working group at the 2019 edition of the
annual Japanese BioHackathon applied logic programming to various problems.
The working group:
\begin{itemize}
\item researched state-of-the-art mapping between graph stores and logic programming;
\item created methods for bridging between SPARQL and in-memory data representations using Prolog;
\item extended the Biolink model;
\item and added Relational Biolink type inference for mediKanren.
\end{itemize}

## Research of state-of-the-art logic programming facilities for SPARQL

The working group researched current solutions for combining logic
programming with SPARQL.
[ClioPatria](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj1074.pdf)
is an in-memory RDF quad-store tightly coupled with SWI-Prolog by Jan
Wielemaker, the main author of SWI-Prolog
[@WielemakerBHO15]. SWI-Prolog is published under a BSD license, and
there even exist bindings for
[ClioPatria and Python](http://wi.hwtk.de/WLP2018/Papers/WLP_2018_paper_4.pdf),
for example, although we were unable to locate the source code. We
think ClioPatria and SWI-Prolog are particularly useful for teaching,
and for (in-memory) semantic web applications. SWI-Prolog comes with
client libraries for SQL and SPARQL queries.

## Accessing biological databases using SPARQLProg

A number of biological databases make their data available in RDF
format, supporting SPARQL access---for example,
[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/),
[NCBI Pubchem](https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rdf) and the
[EBI RDF platform](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/).
SPARQL provides a subset of what logic programming can do.
However, SPARQL queries lack the property of composability and there is no way to
reuse modular components across queries.  For example, to execute a
range query on a genomic region using the FALDO model [@Bolleman:2016]
requires authoring a complex query over many triples. If we then wish
to reuse parts of that query in a more complex query, we have to
manually compose this together.

The working group added codes to
[SPARQLProg](https://github.com/cmungall/sparqlprog) which provides a
way to define modular query components using logic programming.
SPARQLProg is written in
SWI-Prolog and has a Python interface library. All code has been made
available in the example directory of
SPARQLProg which provides
sophisticated mapping of logic queries to SPARQL.

For example, a 4-part predicate `feature_in_range` can be composed
with a binary <nobr>`has_mouse_ortholog`</nobr> predicate:

    feature_in_range(grch38:’X’, 10000000, 20000000, HumanGene),
    has_mouse_ortholog(HumanGene, MouseGene)

This will compile down to a more complex SPARQL query, and execute it against a remote endpoint.

SPARQLProg now includes bindings for many common biological SPARQL
endpoints. As part of this hackathon we developed codes to access RDF
databases of MBGD [@Chiba:2015], KEGG OC, TogoVar, JCM, Allie, EBI
BioSamples, UniProt, and DisGeNET [@Queralt:2016]. Future work includes using these
Prolog codes as building blocks for integrative analysis.

## Extending the Biolink Model

The [Biolink Model](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model) is a
data model developed for representing biological and biomedical
knowledge. It includes a schema and generated objects for the data
model and upper ontology. The BioLink Model was designed with the goal
of standardizing the way information is represented in a graph store,
regardless of the formalism used. The working group focused on
extending this model to support representation of a wide variety of
knowledge.

The following tasks were accomplished as part of the BioHackathon:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Represent datasets and their related metadata
\item Represent family and pedigree information to support clinical knowledge
\item Make the provenance model more rich and descriptive
\end{enumerate}

For future work, the group will ensure that the new classes added to
the model will have appropriate mappings to other schemas and
ontologies.

##  Relational Biolink type inference for mediKanren

miniKanren is an embedded Domain Specific Language for logic
programming.  The goal was to implement a relational type inferencer
for the [Biolink Model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) in
miniKanren, which can be integrated into mediKanren. The working group
added a `yaml` subdirectory to the mediKanren GitHub page, and created
multiple files in https://github.com/webyrd/mediKanren/yaml where
`yaml2sexp.py` generates the `biolink.scm` file which contains an
s-expression version of the Biolink yaml file. `yaml.scm` contains
miniKanren relations, and Chez Scheme code that generates miniKanren
relations based on `biolink.scm`. These are giant miniKanren `conde`
clauses that can be thought of as relational tables.  `yaml.scm` also
contains tests for the relations.

Future work includes:

1. integrating this work into the Racket mediKanren code;
2. integrating with the data categories in the KGs;
3. and creating query editor with decent type error messages, autocompletion,
   query synthesis, etc.

# Discussion

The working group concluded that there is ample scope for logic
programming in bioinformatics. Future work includes expansion of
accessing semantic web databases using SPARQLProg, expanding the
BioLink model, and adding dynamic SPARQL support to miniKanren.
